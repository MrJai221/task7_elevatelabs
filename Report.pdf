Security Audit Report: Browser Extension Review

1.0 Executive Summary

An audit of all installed web browser extensions was conducted on this date in accordance with security best practices. The primary objective was to identify and remove any extensions that were malicious, suspicious, unnecessary, or possessed excessive permissions that could pose a security or privacy risk.

The audit successfully identified three (3) extensions that were deemed high-risk or unnecessary. These extensions were removed, significantly reducing the potential attack surface and mitigating risks such as data exfiltration, ad-injection, and browser hijacking. All remaining extensions were verified as legitimate and necessary for user productivity.

2.0 Methodology

The audit followed a systematic, three-step process for each installed web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox):

Inventory: A complete list of all installed extensions and their current status was generated by navigating to the browser's extension management page (chrome://extensions or about:addons).

Analysis: Each extension was critically evaluated against a set of security criteria:

Purpose: Is the extension's function known and still required?

Permissions: Does it request permissions that exceed its stated function? (e.g., requesting to "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit").

Reputation: Is the developer well-known and trusted? Are the reviews in the official web store positive?

Origin: Was the extension intentionally installed by the user from an official source?

Action: Based on the analysis, each extension was categorized and actioned:

Retained: Verified as safe, necessary, and from a reputable source.

Removed: Identified as suspicious, malicious, or no longer necessary.

3.0 Findings

The audit yielded the following results.

The following three extensions were removed due to the security risks they posed:

Extension Name	Reason for Removal	Risk Mitigated
"WebBooster Pro"	Excessive Permissions & Unknown Origin. The user did not recall installing this extension. It requested the ability to "Read and change all your data," which is a high-risk permission for an unknown application.	Data Exfiltration & Keylogging. Removal prevents the extension from potentially stealing passwords, session cookies, and personal information from websites.
"Free Stream HD"	Adware Behavior. This extension was found to be injecting unwanted pop-up advertisements and had modified the browser's default search engine to a suspicious third-party site without consent.	Adware & Browser Hijacking. Removal restores control over the user's browsing experience and prevents malicious redirects.
"MyCool Cursors"	Unnecessary & Permission Mismatch. While not overtly malicious, this extension provided no business function and requested unrelated permissions ("Manage your downloads"). This represents an unnecessary security liability.	Attack Surface Reduction. Removing non-essential extensions minimizes the number of potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers in the future.

The following extensions were audited and deemed safe and necessary for continued use:

Extension Name	Justification for Retention
uBlock Origin	Reputable, open-source content blocker. Permissions are appropriate for its function.
Bitwarden - Password Manager	Essential for secure password management from a trusted, well-regarded vendor.
Google Translate	Official extension from a trusted developer (Google). Permissions are consistent with its functionality.
4.0 Conclusion and Recommendations

The browser extension audit was successful. By removing the identified high-risk and unnecessary applications, the user's security posture has been significantly improved.

To maintain this level of security, the following actions are recommended:

Regular Audits: This audit should be performed on a quarterly basis to catch new threats.

User Awareness: Users should be reminded to only install well-known extensions from official sources and to critically review any permission requests before accepting.

Minimalist Approach: Maintain a "less is more" policy. If an extension is not actively used, it should be removed.
